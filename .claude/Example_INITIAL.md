## FEATURE:
Develop a Streamlit-based chatbot platform that integrates LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and Chroma vector database to provide Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The platform must support conversational memory maintaining the last three message history, allow users to create and manage knowledge bases, and enable knowledge base switching during conversations. Key requirements include:

1. Professional ChatGPT-like user interface with streaming responses
2. PDF document upload and parsing functionality for knowledge base creation
3. Document chunking and vector storage in Chroma database
4. Knowledge base selection at startup and switching capability during conversations
5. RAG implementation with semantic search and contextual response generation
6. Conversation persistence with memory management (3-message history)
7. Clean architecture separating UI logic from core chat/retrieval functionality
8. Session state management for chat history and knowledge base context

The application should bootstrap with a modular structure including document processing pipelines, vector database management, conversation handling, and a responsive Streamlit interface using st.chat_message() and st.chat_input() components.

## EXAMPLES:
Not applicable.

## DOCUMENTATION:
Reference the following authoritative documentation for implementation:

1. **LangChain RAG Tutorial**: https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/ - Comprehensive guide for RAG architecture including indexing pipeline, document loading, text splitting, vector embeddings, and retrieval-generation workflow.

2. **LangChain Conversational Memory**: https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/ - Implementation patterns for maintaining chat history, message sequences, and conversation state using chains and agents approaches.

3. **Chroma Vector Database Integration**: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma/ - Official LangChain-Chroma integration documentation for vector storage, similarity search, and document persistence.

4. **Streamlit Chat Components**: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/chat - Official Streamlit documentation for chat UI components including st.chat_message() and st.chat_input().

5. **Streamlit LLM App Tutorial**: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/chat-and-llm-apps/build-conversational-apps - Best practices for building conversational apps with Streamlit.

Note: LangChain v1.0 will be released in October 2025 with significant framework changes, so ensure compatibility with the latest stable version.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
1. **Architecture**: Implement clean separation between UI layer (Streamlit) and core logic (LangChain/RAG) using src/application and src/core folder structure.

2. **Performance**: Implement efficient document chunking strategies and optimize vector database queries for responsive user experience with streaming capabilities.

3. **Memory Management**: Use LangGraph's checkpointer or similar persistence mechanisms for conversation state, ensuring proper cleanup of old conversations beyond the 3-message limit.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for PDF parsing failures, vector database connection issues, and OpenAI API rate limits.

5. **Security**: Secure OpenAI API key management using environment variables and implement proper input validation for uploaded documents.

6. **Scalability**: Design for potential migration from Streamlit to more robust frontend frameworks for production deployment, while maintaining backend API compatibility.

7. **Dependencies**: Pin critical package versions including langchain-chroma>=0.1.2, chromadb, langchain-openai, and ensure compatibility with the upcoming LangChain v1.0 migration.

8. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for document processing, vector operations, and conversation management components to ensure reliability.
