## 1. Overview
- **Project Name**  
- **Purpose / Mission**: What problem the project solves; high-level vision  
- **Stakeholders**: Who uses this project, who maintains it, who has decision-making power  
- **History / Background**: Origins, decisions made, existing constraints

## 2. Architecture and System Design
- **High-Level Architecture Diagram**: Components/modules and how they interact  
- **Deployment Topology**: Servers, cloud services, databases, external services  
- **Data Flow**: Where data enters, is processed, stored, surfaced; flows between components  
- **Service Interfaces & APIs**: Endpoints, protocols, formats, versioning

## 3. Tech Stack & Environment
- Languages, frameworks, runtime versions  
- Build tools, package managers, CI/CD configuration  
- Testing tools & patterns (unit, integration, end-to-end)  
- Lint, code formatting, style guides  
- Environment config for dev / staging / production (e.g. environment variables, secrets, config files)

## 4. Key Code and File Structure
- Directory layout, key files, what each major folder contains  
- Important configuration files and their roles (e.g. `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, `build scripts`)  
- Entry points for the application(s) (what is “main”, what is startup, initialization)

## 5. Functional Requirements / Features
- Major features described as user stories or use-cases  
- Example flows / scenarios  
- Inputs/outputs, especially for APIs or UI flows

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: latency, throughput, scalability targets  
- Security & Privacy: authentication/authorization, encryption, data storage policies, regulatory compliance  
- Availability & Reliability: uptime targets, backups, disaster recovery  
- Observability: logging, monitoring, error reporting, metrics  
- Maintainability, extensibility, code quality

## 7. Integration Points & Dependencies
- External services (APIs, third-party tools, databases) that the project depends on  
- Versioning and compatibility constraints  
- Internal modules / packages used, internal dependencies

## 8. Environment / Ops & Dev Workflow
- Deployment process and environments (dev/staging/prod)  
- Infrastructure (hosting, cloud providers, containers, serverless, etc.)  
- Secrets / configuration management  
- Build & release pipeline  
- Database migrations, schema management

## 9. Recent Changes / Changelog Highlights
- Major recent architectural decisions or refactors  
- High risk/hot modules or files under active change  
- Known technical debt

## 10. Testing, Quality & Standards
- Testing coverage, major test suites  
- Code review process  
- Static analysis / type checking / linting  
- CI/CD checks and gates

## 11. Risks, Edge Cases, and Open Questions
- Edge cases that are known or likely  
- Known limitations or areas likely to change  
- Security/privacy/performance risk areas  
- Unresolved trade-offs

## 12. Glossary & Conventions
- Acronyms, domain terms, shorthand used in code or docs  
- Naming conventions, coding standards  
- Folder / module conventions (how things are organized)

## 13. References & External Resources
- Links to important external docs / standards / libraries / APIs used  
- Versioned dependencies, external specifications
