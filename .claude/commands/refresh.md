Use our project-analyzer sub-agent to perform a complete fresh analysis of the entire project, ignoring existing CLAUDE.md.

This will overwrite all existing project context. Use when:
- Major architectural changes occurred
- New team members need complete context
- Existing context seems outdated or incorrect

After analysis, completely replace CLAUDE.md with new findings.
