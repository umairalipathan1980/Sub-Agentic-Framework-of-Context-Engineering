# Code Examples and Patterns

This folder contains reference implementations and patterns that AI coding assistants should follow when implementing new features.

## What to Include:
- **Code Structure Patterns** - How you organize modules, imports, classes/functions
- **Testing Patterns** - Test file structure, mocking approaches, assertion styles  
- **Integration Patterns** - API clients, database connections, authentication flows
- **CLI Patterns** - Argument parsing, output formatting, error handling
- **Architecture Patterns** - How components interact, data flow, state management

## Examples Should Demonstrate:
- Project-specific conventions and patterns
- Preferred libraries and their usage
- Error handling approaches
- Testing methodologies
- Code organization principles

## Usage:
Reference these examples in INITIAL.md when requesting new features. AI assistants will use these as templates for consistent implementation.
